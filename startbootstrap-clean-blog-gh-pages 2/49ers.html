        <p>Niners have gone through lots of pain over my lifetime. Through my expereinces we have lost many close games. However, we will find the way to finally get the Super Bowl in my life time. Here are some of the games that I have witnessed and why we lost them:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                2011 NFC Championship
                                <ul>
                                <li>Jan 22, 2012</li>
                                <li>Giants 20-17 49ers</li>
                                <li>Kyle Williams(49ers) fumbles punt return and leads to 49ers loss.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Super Bowl XLVII
                                <ul>
                                    <li>February 3, 2013</li>
                                    <li>Baltimore 34 vs. 31 49ers</li>
                                    <li>Michael Crabtree, 49ers WR, overthrown by Collin Kaepernick for a touchdown. Leads to a 49ers loss</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Super Bowl LIV
                                <ul>
                                    <li>February 2, 2020</li>
                                    <li>Chiefs 31 vs 20 49ers</li>
                                    <li>49ers blow a 20-10 lead in the 4th quarter. mainly due to the the QB Jimmy Garoppolo and his overthrown pass to Sanders in the final quarter.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Super Bowl LVIII
                                <ul>
                                    <li>February 11, 2024</li>
                                    <li>Chiefs 25 vs. 22 49ers</li>
                                    <li>This is the most painful of losses I have experienced as a 49ers fan. It starts with Dre Greenlaws Achilles injury. which completely changed the momentum. Our leader, Brock Purdy, played a beautiful game but due to poor coaching from Shanahan, and elite offense from Patrick Mahomes, the 49ers were defeated. </li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
